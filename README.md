# DS-Project
This is the project about using different sorting algorithims to sort data.
And analyzing the time complexity of each sorting algorithim.
In this five different sorting algorithims are used
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
And the data set, are country names and text rates.
Then this data is being sorted by using each algorithim i.e one algorithin at a time.
Thank you.
