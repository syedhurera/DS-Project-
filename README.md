 # DS-Project
This is the project about using various sorting algorithims to sort data.
And analyzing the time complexity of each algorithim and also the space complexity.
In this project, five different sorting algorithims are used
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
And the data set, are country names and tax rates.
Then this data is being sorted by using each algorithm means one algorithm at a time.
Thank you.
